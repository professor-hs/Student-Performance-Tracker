# Student Performance Tracker

This project is a simple application to track student performance in terms of marks, attendance, and eligibility to sit for exams. The program collects the following data for 5 subjects:
- Marks (out of 100)
- Attendance (in percentage)

It calculates the student's **CGPA** as the average of marks and checks if the student is allowed to sit for exams based on attendance.

## Features
- Input marks and attendance for 5 subjects.
- Calculate CGPA as the average of marks.
- Check if the student is allowed to sit for exams based on attendance (75% attendance required for each subject).

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open the `student_performance_tracker_app.py` file in any Python IDE or text editor.
3. Run the program.
4. Enter the student's name, marks for 5 subjects, and attendance for each subject (in percentage).
5. The program will calculate the CGPA and display if the student is allowed to sit for exams based on their attendance.
